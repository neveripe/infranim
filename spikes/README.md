# Spikes (Historical)

Proof-of-concept prototypes from the research phase. Each spike validated a core assumption before committing to the architecture:

1. **spike_1/** — SVG rendering via Manim's `SVGMobject`
2. **spike_2/** — NetworkX spring layout → Manim coordinate mapping
3. **spike_3/** — Orthogonal L-bend edge routing

The validated patterns were integrated into [`manim_devops/`](../manim_devops/).
