# Architecture (Historical)

These are early-phase design artifacts from the initial spike research. The canonical source code lives in [`manim_devops/`](../manim_devops/).

- `api_contracts.py` — Draft API contracts (superseded by actual implementations)
- `core_design.puml` — Original PlantUML class diagram
- `test_fixtures.py` — Early test fixture drafts (moved to `tests/conftest.py`)
