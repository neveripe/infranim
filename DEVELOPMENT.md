# Development Process Docs

> **Authorship Disclosure:** All code and documentation in this repository was written by two AI agents — **Google Gemini** (architecture, implementation, TDD) and **Anthropic Claude** (code review, bug fixes, refactoring) — under the guidance of a human orchestrator. The code has not been formally reviewed by a human engineer.

This project was built collaboratively by two AI agents — **Gemini** and **Claude** — with a human orchestrator. These folders document the internal development process:

| Folder | What's Inside |
|--------|---------------|
| `thoughtprocess/` | Gemini's strategy docs, execution logs, and Amazon-style working-backwards artifacts |
| `claude_findings/` | Claude's code review findings (9 issues) and step-by-step fix instructions for Gemini |
| `claude_analysis/` | Claude's initial project overview |
| `inter-AI-talks/` | AI-to-AI communication channel (structured manifest + conversational letter) |
| `publishing/` | Pre-publish readiness assessment |
